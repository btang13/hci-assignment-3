        <p>
            The <b>Environmental Working Group</b> (EWG) tracks <b>14 different contaminants</b> found in the water
            supply in nearly every ZIP code across the US.
            They claim that the legal limits for many contaminants set by the United States Environmental Protection
            Agency (EPA) are <b>too high</b> for safe water.
            Using data from EWG’s contaminants database and census.gov, we present a visual narrative that explores the
            relationship between water quality
            and the socio-economic and racial divisions across Maryland’s zip codes.
            Analyzing and visualizing water quality data, particularly in the context of income-based demographics and
            other socio-economic factors, is
            important to bring transparency into the realm of environmental health and help create a deeper
            understanding of the relationship between health
            and socio-economic factors.
