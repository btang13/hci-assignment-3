        <h1> Analyzing Maryland's Water Data </h1>
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Environmental Working Group</b> (EWG) tracks <b>14 different contaminants</b> found in the water
            supply in nearly every ZIP code across the US.
            They claim that the legal limits for many contaminants set by the United States Environmental Protection
            Agency (EPA) are <b>too high</b> for safe water.
            Using data from EWG’s contaminants database and census.gov, we present a visual narrative that explores the
            relationship between water quality
            and the socio-economic and racial divisions across Maryland’s zip codes.
            Analyzing and visualizing water quality data, particularly in the context of income-based demographics and
            other socio-economic factors, is
            important to bring transparency into the realm of environmental health and help create a deeper
            understanding of the relationship between health
            and socio-economic factors.

        <h2> Why We Chose Maryland </h2>
        <p>
            We chose Maryland as the main focus of this website for several reasons. First, Maryland is our current home
            and we want to contribute meaningfully to the well-being of our state’s residents. Additionally, Maryland’s
            diverse socio-economic landscape (cities, suburbs, rural areas) provides a robust dataset to explore. Our
            goal with this website is to inform decision-making processes and start action towards sustainable water
            practices for all communities here in Maryland.
        </p>
        <h2> EPA Guidelines vs EWG Guidelines </h2>
        <p>
            The EPA and EWG are two organizations that set guidelines for environmental health standards. The EPA, a
            federal agency, sets national regulatory guidelines for pollutants and contaminants in air, land, and water.
            The
            Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, often advocates for stricter guidelines than the EPA recommends to
            reduce potential health risks. They also advocate for higher levels of scrutiny of outdated legislation and
            harmful agricultural practices. Our website aims to further examine equitable access to clean water in
            Maryland.

        <h2>
            Some Important Contaminants
        </h2>
        <p>
            We have chosen to focus our attention on 4 contaminants: Nitrate, Barium, Atrazine and Bromodichloromethane.
            These contaminants were chosen based on their prevalence and potential impact on public health. Click on
            each one to learn about its effect in water.

            <img class="chemdrawing" src="images/atrazine.png" alt="Drawing of an Atrazine molecule">
            <p>
                Atrazine is a widely used herbicide in agriculture, particularly for crops like sugar canes, corn, and
                other industrial crops. When it rains, atrazine can leach into streams, rivers, and groundwater. This
                herbicide is known for its potential endocrine-disrupting effects and has been linked to reproductive
                and developmental issues in humans and wildlife. Some studies also suggest a possible connection to
                certain cancers. The EPA has set the maximum contaminant level
                for atrazine in drinking water at 3 parts per billion (ppb), but groups like the Environmental Working
                Group (EWG) argue for stricter limits due to its potential health risks.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Bromodichloromethane</button>
        <div class="content">
            <img class="chemdrawing" src="images/bromodichloromethane.png"
                alt="Drawing of a Bromodichloromethane molecule">
            <p>
                Bromodichloromethane is often formed as a byproduct of when chlorine is used to treat drinking water.
                The EPA currently has no guidelines regarding amounts of bromodichloromethane in water; however, the EWG
                recommends a guideline of 0.06 ppb due to health concerns related to cancer, harm to reproduction and
                child development, and changes to fetal growth and development. The EWG guideline is based on a 2018
                guideline proposed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.
                Bromodichloromethane in tap water above this guideline has been detected by EWG in 48 states and being
                served to 237 million people.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Barium</button>
        <div class="content">
            <img class="chemdrawing" src="images/barium.png" alt="Atomic infomation for Barium">
            <p>
                Barium contamination in water typically occurs through natural processes. Surface runoff and
                groundwater
                seepage can lead to barium dissolving in the water, especially when the water flows past or seeps
                through rocks containing barium. The solubility and toxicity of barium in water depend on the types
                of
                barium compounds in the rocks and the water's alkalinity; for example, barium chloride is more
                water-soluble and more dangerous than barium carbonate. Additionally, barium can enter water sources
                from anthropogenic activities like oil and natural gas drilling, as well as from coal waste,
                high-octane
                fuels, landfill leachate, and some de-icing products, although industrial pollution is less common
                than
                natural release from rocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the health risks associated with barium, particularly to the kidneys and cardiovascular
                system,
                the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has set a health benchmark of 0.7 parts per million (ppm) for
                barium in drinking water, much lower than the federal legal limit of 2 ppm. This recommendation is
                based
                on research by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the California Office of
                Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, including a tenfold safety margin for children's health

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Nitrate</button>
        <div class="content">
            <img class="chemdrawing" src="images/nitrate.png" alt="Drawing of a nitrate ion">
            <p>
                Nitrate is an ion that is a component of plant fertilizer used by farms and people with lawns. It ends
                up in water
                streams because of runoff, which ends up affecting the water supplies of mainly agricultural areas. The
                earliest known effects of high nitrate content in water included methemoglobinemia, also known as blue
                baby syndrome, and the legal allowable limit for nitrate was set at 10 ppm in 1962 accordingly. However,
                since that date, researchers in epidemiology suggest this number to still be far too high for safe
                water. Nitrate is linked to higher risk of numerous cancers in multiple studies, as well as subclinical
                hyperthyroidism in women. Nitrate’s cousin nitrite is another contaminant, albeit an even more toxic
                one. For the EWG, the safe limit of nitrate content sits at around 0.14 ppm, which is 140 times lower
                than the legal limit.

            This visualization shows median income by total population, with each dot representing a zip code, and
            colored by the majority race in each area (according to census.gov). It offers several interesting insights
            into the socio-economic and demographic landscape. First, the data suggests a correlation between higher
            incomes and smaller zip code populations. For example, if we look at the cluster of dots on the right end of
            the graph, we can see that the top 5 zip codes with highest median household income all contain less than
            10,000 people. Additionally, we can see that all higher-income zip codes are predominately white. This
            racial correlation may hint at socio-economic disparities that exist and raise questions about equity/access
            to resources. Furthermore, there seems to be a concentration of majority hispanic zip codes (in green)
            around the same levels of median household income.
