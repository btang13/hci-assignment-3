        <h1> Analyzing Maryland's Water Data </h1>
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Environmental Working Group</b> (EWG) tracks <b>14 different contaminants</b> found in the water
            supply in nearly every ZIP code across the US.
            They claim that the legal limits for many contaminants set by the United States Environmental Protection
            Agency (EPA) are <b>too high</b> for safe water.
            Using data from EWG’s contaminants database and census.gov, we present a visual narrative that explores the
            relationship between water quality
            and the socio-economic and racial divisions across Maryland’s zip codes.
            Analyzing and visualizing water quality data, particularly in the context of income-based demographics and
            other socio-economic factors, is
            important to bring transparency into the realm of environmental health and help create a deeper
            understanding of the relationship between health
            and socio-economic factors.

        <h2> Why We Chose Maryland </h2>
        <p>
            We chose Maryland as the main focus of this website for several reasons. First, Maryland is our current home
            and we want to contribute meaningfully to the well-being of our state’s residents. Additionally, Maryland’s
            diverse socio-economic landscape (cities, suburbs, rural areas) provides a robust dataset to explore. Our
            goal with this website is to inform decision-making processes and start action towards sustainable water
            practices for all communities here in Maryland.
        </p>
        <h2> EPA Guidelines vs EWG Guidelines </h2>
        <p>
            The EPA and EWG are two organizations that set guidelines for environmental health standards. The EPA, a
            federal agency, sets national regulatory guidelines for pollutants and contaminants in air, land, and water.
            The
            Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, often advocates for stricter guidelines than the EPA recommends to
            reduce potential health risks. They also advocate for higher levels of scrutiny of outdated legislation and
            harmful agricultural practices. Our website aims to further examine equitable access to clean water in
            Maryland.

        <p>
            We have chosen to focus our attention on 4 contaminants: Nitrate, Barium, Atrazine and Bromodichloromethane.
            These contaminants were chosen based on their prevalence and potential impact on public health.

            This visualization shows median income by total population, with each dot representing a zip code, and
            colored by the majority race in each area (according to census.gov). It offers several interesting insights
            into the socio-economic and demographic landscape. First, the data suggests a correlation between higher
            incomes and smaller zip code populations. For example, if we look at the cluster of dots on the right end of
            the graph, we can see that the top 5 zip codes with highest median household income all contain less than
            10,000 people. Additionally, we can see that all higher-income zip codes are predominately white. This
            racial correlation may hint at socio-economic disparities that exist and raise questions about equity/access
            to resources. Furthermore, there seems to be a concentration of majority hispanic zip codes (in green)
            around the same levels of median household income.
